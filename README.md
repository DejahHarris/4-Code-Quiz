# 4-Code-Quiz
# Description
For challenge four, I built a timed code quiz that's made up of multiple-choice questions. This app will run in the browser and feature dynamically updated HTML and CSS powered by your JavaScript code. It will also feature a clean and polished user interface and be responsive, ensuring that it adapts to multiple screen sizes.
